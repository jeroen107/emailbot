Dear Mr. Justice, I am writing this mail to you with heavy sorrow in my heart, this massage mighty comes to you as a surprise but I chose to reach you through this email because it still remains the fastest medium of communicating with you. Please this is my last day on the Slave trade but I must this very day Mack will like to know whether you are following my lead, whether you are taking part in the trade or are simply not following the money because you do not understand it. 
You are not to face me or my family or anybody like that. I will kill myself to clear this earth from under you but you must understand that I am not going to behead you for it, for I do not want you to see this because I have promised to give you a great deal better than I have with a black eye. 
Also please this is not a joke, I will kill you to clear this earth from under you. Please don't come to my house and say, "What the f--- is going on?"

My name is John Abner, I work for the US Coast Guard in South Carolina and am the first African-American in the whole of the crew of the UNSC Pacific Fleet. I was on a secret mission to South Africa to assist the sister African Space Center while on an exploratory flight that ended with the safety of the girl team at that center. After the space shuttle rolled off the downing of the foreign country into the hands of the country's criminals, I was stranded there with no one to report to. Now that I know what I am doing, where I want to land, and how I can best help make the most of this opportunity, I've decided. I will give you why this decision was made, as well as any concerns that may occur to you. 1. I need your help resolving the issue of Paypal fraud.

We understand that some cards will be suspended due to card notifications, so this is a big deal. Please take this opportunity to thank you for your time. 
Sincerely,
