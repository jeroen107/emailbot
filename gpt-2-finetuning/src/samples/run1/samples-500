About us: We are a family owned, not-for-profit hospital chain that is looking for a team leader who can help make a difference in each other's annual financials. 
We start out as a private foundation and by the end of the day, we've accumulated substantial amounts over budget. 
We believe that being a part of a large-scale charity work can be a powerful way to generate income. 
We need you to help us to reach this goal. Fill out the online application and let us know what you are going to be doing by October 01, 2018. 
Your Organization: 
We're pretty much done with this office. Here are a few things we learned while in this office: 
1. Social Media is not the most effective way to reach out to a new set of fans. 
We found that 80% of our members didn't reply to messages that came in through their browser. That number has jumped to 96% since we sent out the call. 
If you haven't reported to your MPO within the last month, we noticed you can still email us at [email protected] to request an update. If you don't want to be contacted, kindly message us at
